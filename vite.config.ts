 * Every build-time flag is defined here, ALWAYS, even when unset.
 *
 * This is not belt-and-braces — it is the difference between the flag folding
 * and not. Vite replaces `import.meta.env` with an object literal holding only
 * the vars it actually loaded, so an UNSET var compiles to a runtime property
 * lookup on that object (`const x = {}; x.VITE_ADMINIUM_SURFACE_SIDE`) which no
 * minifier will fold. The branch then survives, and code meant for one build
 * ships in another. Measured: the demo bundle carried the whole same-origin
 * session transport for exactly this reason, and defining the var to `""`
 * dropped it.
 *
 * `define` always emits a literal, so absence becomes `""` rather than a lookup
 * and `SURFACE_SIDE`/`HOSTED`/`DEMO` in `src/surface.ts` fold in every build.

/*
 * THE HOSTED DEV LOOP.
 *
 * A hosted surface is served BY Adminium precisely so it shares an origin with
 * the session cookie — which is what a separate Vite dev server breaks, and why
 * hosted mode looked like it had no HMR. It does: this proxies the API back to
 * a local Adminium, so `vite dev` serves the screens with hot reload while the
 * session and the data still come from the real server.
 *
 * `changeOrigin: false` IS the mechanism, and the common default would break
 * it. CSRF leg A derives the expected origin from the request's own `Host`
 * (`apps/server/src/security/csrf.ts`); `changeOrigin: true` rewrites Host to
 * the target, leaving `Origin: localhost:5217` against `Host: localhost:4715`
 * and 403ing every write. Leaving Host alone keeps them equal.
 *
 * MEASURED, not assumed — reads, writes and HMR all verified against a live
 * instance. With the token a write returns its normal validation response; the
 * same write without one still returns `403 CSRF_FAILED`, so the proxy relaxes
 * nothing. The cookie crosses the port because cookies are host-scoped and
 * ignore ports, which is also why you sign in ONCE on Adminium's own origin and
 * the dev server is already authenticated.
