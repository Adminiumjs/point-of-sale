/**
 * THE BUILD-TIME SPLIT IS REAL, AND STAYS REAL.
 *
 * Three rules keep the demo out of a customer's bundle. All three were learned
 * by measuring, all three are one careless edit from silently reversing, and
 * none of them shows up as a type error, a lint warning or a failing unit test.
 * Before this file the only thing defending them was a comment.
 *
 * ── The rules, and how each one fails ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. NO CALL AROUND A FLAG. Vite substitutes `import.meta.env.X` with a literal,
 *    but Rollup will not fold a CALL — so `Boolean(a && b)` leaves the branch
 *    live and the demo dock ships. `!!(a && b)` folds. The difference is
 *    invisible in review and invisible at runtime; it shows up only in the bytes.
 *
 * 2. DOT ACCESS, NEVER BRACKETS — and this is the one that actually decides it.
 *    With DOT access Vite substitutes `import.meta.env.VITE_X` with a literal,
 *    and with `undefined` when the variable is unset; either folds. With BRACKET
 *    access it substitutes the whole `import.meta.env` OBJECT instead, leaving
 *    `const x = {}; x.VITE_X` — a runtime lookup no minifier folds, and the
 *    branch survives.
 *
 * 3. Every flag is also `define`d in `vite.config.ts`. MEASURED, and stated
 *    honestly: this is defence in depth, NOT what makes the elimination work.
 *    Removing the whole `define` block changes nothing while rule 2 holds — the
 *    dock still disappears from both surfaces and still ships in the demo. It
 *    earns its place by making a future slip into bracket access harmless
 *    rather than silent, and that is the only claim made for it.
 *
 *    An earlier version of this header claimed `define` was load-bearing. It
 *    was measured on code that used bracket access at the time, which made rule
 *    2's failure look like rule 3's.
 *
 * ── Why this builds instead of reading source ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Rules 1 and 2 are properties of the OUTPUT. Source that looks correct can
 * still produce a bundle with the dock in it, which is precisely what happened:
 * the guard read `{DEMO && <DemoDock />}` — correct by inspection — while
 * `DEMO` was compiled as a runtime lookup and the dock shipped anyway. Only the
 * built bytes can answer this, so this file builds all three modes and greps
 * them.
 *
 * ── Why it must never skip ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A missing `dist/`, a missing component, a missing marker: every one of those
 * FAILS here rather than skipping. A gate that skips when its subject is absent
 * reports green while checking nothing, which is how this fleet's manifest test
 * stayed blind for months. If something below cannot be located, that is a
 * finding, not a reason to stand down.
 *
 * ── The demo's tools, and the demo protocol ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An app that still ships its own `DemoDock.tsx` is marked by the dock's class
 * names. One that moved to the website's demo card (`src/demoBridge.ts`) has no
 * dock; its demo tools are marked by the protocol's own message prefix, read
 * from `src/demo-types.ts`. Either way the demo build must carry them and no
 * surface build may — and no surface build may speak the protocol at all.
 *
 * ── A customer bundle carries nothing from the till ─────────────────────────
 *
 * An app with a customer side builds it with source maps, and the modules in
 * them are checked against the staff-only screens `src/surface-nav.ts`
 * declares (`src/screens/<View>.tsx`). A guest's page that shipped the till
 * would ship its code, its strings and its endpoints to every visitor.
 *
 * ── Markers are derived, not written down ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The strings this file greps for are pulled out of the very files it guards.
 * Hardcoding `"ol-dock"` would mean a renamed class silently disarms the gate —
 * the test would keep passing while the dock shipped. Deriving them means a
 * rename either keeps working or fails loudly, and never quietly.
