/**
 * The SAME-ORIGIN transport: this app served BY Adminium, reading through the
 * operator's own session instead of a publishable key.
 *
 * ─── What this is for ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A standalone build talks to `/api/v1/public/*` with an `adm_pub_` key. That
 * key is a NON-PRINCIPAL: it consults no roles, and what it may reach is fixed
 * by a scope an operator wrote. Correct for a customer storefront, wrong for a
 * staff console: these apps read every customer's records, and the guard in
 * `adminiumSource.ts` says so out loud by refusing a customer-side scope.
 *
 * Hosted at Adminium's own origin under `/apps/<key>/staff/`, none of that is
 * needed. The browser already holds the operator's session cookie, so this
 * transport reads `/api/v1/data/:connectionId/:table` exactly as the dashboard
 * does — same session, same RBAC, no key to mint, no scope to keep in sync, no
 * CORS allowance. That is the whole argument for hosting, reduced to a file.
 *
 * ─── Three facts about the wire, all verified against the server ─────────────
 *
 * 1. CSRF has two legs. Leg A (Origin / `Sec-Fetch-Site`) passes for free here
 *    — same origin is the point. Leg B is a session-bound token handed out by
 *    `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` and echoed in `x-adminium-csrf` on every mutation.
 *    Reads never carry it; `mutate()` below always does.
 * 2. `limit` caps at 200 on this route, not the public API's 500.
 *    `apps/server/src/routes/data/schema.ts` — paging is not optional.
 * 3. `credentials: 'same-origin'` is required. `fetch` omits cookies from
 *    cross-origin requests by default and this file must never be used
 *    cross-origin anyway; stating it makes the same-origin assumption explicit
 *    rather than accidental.
 *
 * ─── Where the tenant's timezone comes from ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The CONNECTION carries it. This transport already fetches
 * `/api/v1/connections` to discover which database the app reads, so the zone
 * arrives on the same response with no extra request and nothing to configure
 * in the build.
 *
 * It used to be a build argument, which made a property of the BUSINESS a
 * property of the artifact: changing your timezone meant rebuilding the front
 * end. The one answer that is always wrong is
 * `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` — that is the READER's
 * zone, not the business's, and it fails silently by an hour. This module never
 * guesses the reader's zone: no zone on the connection means UTC, flagged, so
 * the app can say so on screen (see the fallback in `config()`).
 */
