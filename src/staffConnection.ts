/**
 * WHICH CONNECTION a hosted STAFF surface reads.
 *
 * ─── Why this has to be asked at all ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A CUSTOMER surface never had to: its publishable key names a scope, and a
 * scope names a connection (`NOT NULL` since meta wave 0014). The STAFF side has
 * no key BY DESIGN — it reads through the operator's own session — and that key
 * was also the thing carrying the identity. Nothing replaced it, so the app
 * inferred its database from "the only connection serving". Correct on the
 * single-connection instance nearly every install is; silently wrong on any
 * other, where the app reads somebody else's database and reports it as a pile
 * of absent tables.
 *
 * Adminium now serves the answer beside the bundle, and this reads it.
 *
 * ─── Why its own module, and not `publicConfig.ts` ───────────────────────────
 *
 * It shares a URL with the customer-side config and nothing else: no key, no
 * base URL, no resolution order. Keeping it there would also have dragged that
 * synced file — and the whole served-KEY mechanism it carries — into repos that
 * have not adopted it, which is a different task wearing this one's clothes.
 *
 * ─── `null` is a complete answer ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An unbound surface returns it, and so does every Adminium older than the
 * binding. It means "keep inferring", never "something failed", so this never
 * blocks boot.
